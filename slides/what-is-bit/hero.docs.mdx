import { Hero } from './hero';

A hero component showcasing components and their dependencies.

### Hero with title and teaser

Pass the `title`, `teaser` and [`bubble graph`](https://bit.dev/teambit/community/entity/graph/bubble-graph) props to have them rendered by the Hero component.

```js live
<Hero
  title="Build anything in components"
  teaser="Forget about monolithic apps, start building component-driven software. Bit helps developers build better software with independent components and compose them into infinite features and apps."
  bubbles={mockBubbleGraph()}
/>
```
